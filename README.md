# Neuroplex
Neuroplex for complex event detection using NRlogic. 

The goal is to construct a neural symbolic structure that takes human knowledge in doing complex event detection. 

The inference pipeline is discussed in [DeepCEP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8784054). Latest inference pipeline and real-time demo for DeepCEP is available [here](https://github.com/nesl/DeepCEPppDemo)


## Future work:
- Experiment on more dataset: video, text, IMU, etc
- Investigate the system performance with noisy labels
- Investigate the how the uninformed event would affect system performance 
- Propose method to implement the idea to real scenario (For time series data, annotation should be window-independent)

# Neuroplex
Neuroplex for complex event detection using NRlogic.

The goal is to construct a neural symbolic structure that takes human knowledge in doing complex event detection. 

The inference pipeline is discussed in [DeepCEP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8784054). Latest inference pipeline and real-time demo for DeepCEP is available [here](https://github.com/nesl/DeepCEPppDemo)

## Core Code
contains main code for MNIST simulation

## MNIST experiment
contains simulation code for MNIST simulation in IPSN paper (generated data and models are not stored.)

## Audio experiment
contains simulation code for Audio simulation in IPSN paper (generated data and models are not stored.)

## Paper Result plot
contains the results generated by the above 2 experiments.

## Future work:
- Experiment on more dataset: imagenet, text, IMU, etc
- Investigate the system performance with noisy labels
- Investigate the how the uninformed event would affect system performance 
- Propose method to implement the idea to real scenario (For time series data, annotation should be window-independent)
